## Introduction:
*	Introducing foodlib (kind of like ad-lib, but with food). The easiest way to explain it is “tinder for food” without the gross feeling of disappointment and embarrassment. A quick way to match yourself up with a new food that you haven’t tried before. It will use your location to see where you are and recommend you foods around your neighborhood or walking distance. First it was developed for the web but later with hopes of becoming a mobile app.

## Genre
* A food delivery service unlike anything else out there. Sure there are many food ordering apps around, but not any like this. It will be a thrilling experience every time you log in to order food.

## How it works
* The user will log in or sign up. They will need to provide some basic info like address, etc... with options to update/delete the information.
* Then the user will press the `Find It` button.
* This will trigger an API call to devivery.com to grab all the local area restaurants and places that have food.
* It will then do some magic and then spit out only one random item from one menu.
* The user will be provided with the food item name, restaurant info, ratings, price and google maps location of the restaurant.
* Then the user will have an option to either press `Oh Yea` or `Next Item`. If they don't like what they see, they can go to the next random item from a random menu around them.
* Once the user picks an item, it will be added to their favorites, which can be viewed in my profile.
* Eventually, the goal is to build a cart and be able to add the items into that and place orders. And then go on to making it into a phone app.


## Target audience:
*	The audience is simple, it’s not an app just for “foodies”, but also for people who want to experience new foods.
* It is for the person who is tired of not knowing what to get and always ends up ordering the same old crap to eat.
For the person who is sick and tired of “the usual”.
* For the one who wants to break out of their shell and try new delicious foods. We live in New York, there are so many different foods and cultures out there to experience, why subject yourself to “that one deli with the guy who makes a good ham and cheese sandwich the way you like, but puts too much mayo and you are afraid to tell him.”?

## Most compelling features:
* The best feature of this app is that it will randomly suggest meals for you to get, but not the whole menu, so you are overwhelmed. For example, you say you want to get a meal for one, it will randomly choose a restaurant nearby, go to that menu, and pick just one specialty item (usually the one with the highest customer rating) for you to try out. All you have to do is swipe left if you don’t want it, or swipe right if you want to place the order. It’s fast, easy, spontaneous and fun. (these features will be available on the phone app version only.)
